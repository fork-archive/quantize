# quantize
quantization of the self

A personal project of mine that I use to track statistics about myself. Currently limited to just tracking how much time I spend on what things (mainly as a way of showing my university's ECE department that they make us do too much work for too little learning), I use and develop it simultaneously in Emacs+SLIME.
